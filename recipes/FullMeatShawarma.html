    <p>Shawarma is a flavorful Middle Eastern street food made from marinated meat, 
        usually lamb, chicken, or beef, that’s grilled or roasted on a vertical spit.
         To make the shawarma marinade, mix yogurt, olive oil, lemon juice, and a variety 
         of spices like cumin, paprika, turmeric, garlic powder, cinnamon, and allspice. 
         The combination of these spices gives the meat its signature savory, tangy, and 
         aromatic flavor. Once your marinade is ready, coat the meat (cut into strips or 
         chunks) and let it marinate for several hours or overnight to really absorb the flavors.</p>
    <p>For cooking, you can either grill the marinated meat on skewers or 
        pan-fry it until it’s golden brown and crispy on the edges. Serve the
         cooked meat in pita bread or flatbreads with toppings like fresh vegetables
          (tomato, cucumber, onions), lettuce, and a drizzle of garlic sauce or tahini. 
          You can also add pickles and fresh herbs like parsley or mint for extra zing.
           Shawarma is perfect for a hearty sandwich or wrap, and it’s guaranteed to
            satisfy with its rich, spiced flavor!</p>
