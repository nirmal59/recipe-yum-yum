    <p>Teriyaki is a popular Japanese glaze and marinade, known for its sweet and savory balance, 
        typically used on grilled or broiled meats, fish, or even tofu. The base of the sauce includes
         soy sauce, sugar (usually brown sugar), and mirin, with garlic, ginger, and sometimes sesame
          oil for added depth. To make the sauce, simply combine these ingredients in a saucepan and 
          simmer until the sugar dissolves and the sauce thickens into a syrupy consistency.
           It’s often used both as a marinade and as a finishing glaze, giving your dish a 
           beautiful shine and rich flavor.</p>
    <p>For the teriyaki chicken, beef, or salmon, marinate the protein in the sauce for at least 30 
        minutes, allowing the flavors to penetrate. Then, cook the meat either by grilling, 
        pan-searing, or broiling, basting with the reserved sauce until caramelized and slightly 
        charred. The end result is a dish that’s savory, slightly sweet, and bursting with umami, 
        perfect when served with steamed rice and vegetables. It’s quick, versatile, and always a 
        crowd-pleaser!</p>
